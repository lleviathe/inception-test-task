# Test assignment for Inception Technology

## Stack: Docker, PHP 8.3, MariaDB, Redis, Laravel 11, Scribe, Pest, Laravel Pint, OpenAPI

## Platform is based on Laravel Sail

## Features:

- [x] Feature/integration tests based on Pest
- [x] Code coverage: 100% of actual business logic
- [x] Latest PHP 8.3/Laravel 11 improvements and features
- [x] Laravel Pint for codestyle fixing and linting
- [x] Application is deployed on Docker Compose, which makes it easy to deploy and run the application
- [x] Comprehensive documentation, which is generated by Scribe automatically (but, of course, you can change it
  manually) including code examples on PHP, JS and Bash, Postman collection and OpenAPI specification
- [x] Isolated application layers with low coupling between them
- [x] Redis-powered caching and queueing system
- [x] Easily extensible and maintainable code with high level of readability and type safety
- [x] Easy to use and intuitive API

## May be improved:

- [ ] Redis replication for high availability, failover and load balancing, as well as for scaling the application
- [ ] Automatic cache actualization mechanism (scheduled job or event-driven)
- [ ] Error handling and logging (e.g by using Sentry)
- [ ] API versioning
- [ ] Detailed API documentation with more examples and explanations
- [ ] Overall code coverage: over 90% (it's not neccessary to cover all the code with tests, but it's nice to have)

## Start the project:

    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d

## Run the tests:

    ./vendor/bin/sail php artisan test
